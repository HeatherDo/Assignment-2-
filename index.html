<pre><code>                                                 Open Source Project: IoTivity
</code></pre>

<p>For this mini research assignment, I’ve decided to focus on IoT; The Internet of Things and its ecosystems are becoming more popular as more and more devices are populating online and a growing trend amongst millennial users. By 2020, it is expected to connect over billions and billions of devices. One of the problems that IoT is currently facing is the challenge to securely and safely connect these devices to the Internet and each other. </p>

<p>Project: The IoTivity is an open source project that is sponsored by the Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC), a group of industry leaders hoping to create standards and certifications programs to address the current problem description. The purpose of this project is to deliver OIC standard specification to open source reference implementation. The drivers of this project is called the IoTivity Steering Group, ISG manages and make the overall decisions of IoTivity. </p>

<p>Project Governance: This project is independent from it sponsors, the body of governance for this project are the contributors, project maintainer, architect, and function leader. A contributor, is anyone such as the community who would like to contribute to the project. The project maintainer is also a contributor but they also maintain a particular section of code. Sub-maintainers are contributors who are directed by the project maintainer. Project architect is responsible for knowing, directing, and anticipating the architectural needs of IoTivity source codes. To begin contributing participants need to create an account Contributors can follow vis blog, Twitter, Google Plus, Facebook, LinkedIn, and participate via IRC Channel on freenode. 
Processes: To begin contributing, Linux has a set of tools to build the IoTivity code, the commands to initiate the project are used specifically with Ubuntu LTS 12.04. IoTivity uses Git source code management software to gain access to the IoTivity. Secure shell is also required to connect to Git repository so others can view the source code. G++ version 4.6.1 and Boost version 1.55 is needed to build IoTivity stack. To generate API documentations, IoTivity uses Doxygen and all source codes can be downloaded directly from IoTivity webpage or from gerrit. The source codes for the processes described are as follows:</p>

<p>• $ sudo apt-get install git-core</p>

<p>• $ sudo apt-get install ssh</p>

<p>• $ sudo apt-get install build-essential g++</p>

<p>• download boost_1_55_0.tar.gz</p>

<p>• $ tar xzvf boost_1_55_0.tar.gz</p>

<p>• $ cd boost_1_55_0/</p>

<p>• $ ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=system,filesystem,date_time,thread,regex,log,iostreams,program_options --prefix=/usr/local</p>

<p>• $ sudo ./b2 install</p>

<p>• $ sudo sh -c 'echo '/usr/local/lib' &gt;&gt; /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf'</p>

<p>• $ sudo ldconfig</p>

<p>• $ sudo apt-get install doxygen</p>
